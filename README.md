#Eos: Dawn
A game I made to try and learn Ruby.

It's a choose your own adventure style game.

I made and tested it with Ruby 2.5.3p105 (2018-10-18 revision 65156)

If you have Ruby installed, you can download the game and run the init.rb file to start.

When the game starts it will:
* See if there is a save file. If no, it will strat a new game.
* If there is it will ask if you want to start a new game, load a file or delete a save file.
8 If you start a new game, it will ask your name. If you enter a name that there is already a save file for, it will ask you if you want to use that file or overwrite the file.
* The game allows for 6 save files.
* Enter the option numbers for the one you whish to choose.
